                <p>Tim Berners-Lee (born June 8, 1955, London, England) is a British computer scientist,
                     generally credited as the inventor of the World Wide Web. 
                     In 2004, he was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and the inaugural Millennium Technology Prize (â‚¬1 million) 
                     by the Finnish Technology Award Foundation.<br /><br />
                     Computing came naturally to Berners-Lee, as both of his parents worked on the Ferranti Mark I, the first commercial computer. 
                     (See computer: The first stored-program machines.) After graduating in 1976 from the University of Oxford, 
                     Berners-Lee designed computer software for two years at Plessey Telecommunications Ltd., 
                     located in Poole, Dorset, England. Following this, he had several positions in the computer industry, 
                     including a stint from June to December 1980 as a software engineering consultant at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory in Geneva.</p>
